# Investment-Portfolio
## Origin of Idea & Aim
- ***This is a Investment Portfolio-based project to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible.*** And for that to happen, the *law of compounding* is used so the earlier we start, the better off we will be.<br>
- Most of the Investment portfolios which are readily available provide a surplus of commission to the portfolio manager, and this project aims to take out that third person between us & finance.<br>

## Key Structure
With that said, we are going to create multiple **low risk and high return portfolios**. What makes them unique is that they demand very little capital because, as students, we are mostly living on our parent's money. Still, this portfolio is an excellent opportunity for all income classes.<br>
We will analyze past data from various equities and other income yielding assets. This portfolio will comprise of:
- Stocks (mostly from mid-cap)
- Government & Corporate Bonds
- Commodities
- Forex Currencies

This will be a diversified portfolio and protect us from systematic and unsystematic risk. This endeavor will act as the stepping stone towards our financial freedom.

## Key Features of the project
- Funds in
- Funds out
- Every month a certain amount will be added to funds it may differ for different users
- This system will also show what is our portfolio each of the user will have a portfolio with 30% difference in it
- In simpler words how much of user's money is allocated to which asset and how high or low it is
- Profit/Loss statement for every month and cumulative Profit/Loss statement
- All the changes in need will be shown in percentage scale

# About Us
Student Managed Investment Portfolio
We, the Quantizers team, have created this web application based product specifically for students and people coming from low-income class.
This web app is the one-stop destination for all your investment needs and leads to a path of financial freedom.
We have mainly used three techniques which are as follows-
Markowitz model
Minimum Variance
Sharpe Ratio maximization

In the first technique, we apply the Markowitz model, which states that we can have a portfolio with variable returns for a fixed variance. As the model speaks for itself, we have carefully selected handpicked stocks using fundamental analysis method to screen those who shined apart from the hundreds of other stocks present in the Indian Stock Indices.

After selecting those few stocks, we apply the Markowitz model on them by fixing the variance to a set value and optimizing it to achieve the highest returns.
In the minimum variance model, we select stocks that generate steady revenue and minimize the portfolio variance to achieve a portfolio that comprises equity, which can hold their own even in the darkest of times.
The final one is the Sharpe Ratio model in which we maximize using Monte Carlo simulations to achieve an aggressive portfolio that comprises stocks capable of generating exquisite returns, which will result in an increment of your net worth by a considerable margin, but they also come with significant risk.
