# Investment-Portfolio
## Origin of Idea & Aim
- ***This is a Investment Portfolio-based project to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible.*** And for that to happen, the *law of compounding* is used so the earlier we start, the better off we will be.<br>
- Most of the Investment portfolios which are readily available provide a surplus of commission to the portfolio manager, and this project aims to take out that third person between us & finance.<br>

## Key Structure
With that said, we are going to create multiple **low risk and high return portfolios**. What makes them unique is that they demand very little capital because, as students, we are mostly living on our parent's money. Still, this portfolio is an excellent opportunity for all income classes.<br>
We will analyze past data from various equities and other income yielding assets. This portfolio will comprise of:
- Dividend-yielding equity
- Stocks mostly from mid-cap
- Government and corporate bonds
- Commodities
- Forex(Currencies)

This will be a diversified portfolio and protect us from systematic and unsystematic risk. This endeavor will act as the stepping stone towards our financial freedom.

## Key Features of the project
