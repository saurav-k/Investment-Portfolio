# Investment-Portfolio
A Student managed Investment Portfolio
We have created this Investment Portfolio-based project because we want to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible. And for that to happen, we will use the law of compounding so the earlier we start, the better off we will be. 
Most of the Investment portfolios which are readily available provide a surplus of commission to the portfolio manager, and we want to take our finance into our own hands.
With that said, we are going to create multiple low risk and high return portfolios. What makes them unique is that they demand very little capital because, as students, we are mostly living on our parent's money. Still, this portfolio is an excellent opportunity for all income classes.
We will analyze past data from various equities and other income yielding assets. Our portfolio will comprise of
Dividend-yielding equity,
Stocks mostly from mid-cap,
Government and corporate bonds,
Commodities,
& Forex(Currencies).
And we will add other things if the need arises.
This will be a diversified portfolio and protect us from systematic and unsystematic risk. This endeavor will act as the stepping stone towards our financial freedom.
